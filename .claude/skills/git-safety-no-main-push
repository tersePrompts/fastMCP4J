Title: Git Safety - No Direct Main Pushes

**Core Rule**: Never push directly to main branch. Always create pull requests.

**When working as an AI agent**:
- Before any git push operation, check current branch
- If current branch is 'main' or 'master', refuse to push
- Instead, create a feature branch and raise a PR
- Use `gh pr create` for pull request creation

**Safe Git Workflow**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push feature branch: `git push -u origin feature/description`
4. Create pull request: `gh pr create --title "Description" --body "Summary"`
5. Never: `git push origin main`

**Verification Steps**:
- Always run `git branch --show-current` before pushing
- If it returns 'main' or 'master', stop and create a feature branch
- Use `git status` to verify working directory state
- Check `gh pr list` to see existing PRs

**Emergency Override**:
Only push to main if explicitly instructed with "override main protection" or similar clear override command.
